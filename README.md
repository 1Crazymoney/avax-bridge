This repository is forked from the [token-liquidity](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/token-liquidity) app. The purpose of this avax-bridge app is to allow the transfer for tokens between the AVAX and BCH blockchains. Sending a token to this app on one chain, will cause the app to burn the tokens on that chain and re-mint them on the other chain.
