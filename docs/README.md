# Documentation
The token-liquidity app is based on [this Koa boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/koa-api-boilerplate), which is a web server build in node.js JavaScript. Developers who wish to modify this code base for their own token should familiarize themselves with that boilerplate first. The rest of this document will address the code specific to the token-liquidity app.
